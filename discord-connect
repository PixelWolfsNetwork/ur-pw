This is a Writing-Connection Site with Discord Group

How it's works?
this is not a java code. it's a RandomP-jv file (a code program created by UniversoRandom Team)


.html/discord
.discord/api.html
   {group=id}
 //github.html
 dev.import.java/discord/docs
         import.java group={id}
    discord.api
set.group
 >import.java.discord/docs.groups
                          {id=ur-pw}
             dev.import.java/.html.github
                        >PixelWolfsNetwork.ur-pw
   set.discord {id}

dev.import.java. {dev.build=id}
